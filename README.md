# MOR-of-DAE-QO-systems
Algorithms for Model Order Reduction of Differential-Algebraic Systems with Quadratic Output
Abstract: Model order reduction (MOR) is used to construct a low-rank approximation of a large-scale
system. MOR of linear time-invariant (LTI) system is well established. Recently MOR of linear
dynamical systems with quadratic output (LD-QO) has also been reported in the literature. In
our study, we consider differential-algebraic systems with quadratic output (DAE-QO) also known
as the descriptor system with quadratic output. We propose a balanced truncation model order
reduction (BT-MOR) method for the index-1 DAE-QO system. We propose a new method of
defining observability Gramian, Since the conventional observability Gramian wonâ€™t work here due
to the non-linearity of the output. All these results are applicable for index-1 DAE systems.
